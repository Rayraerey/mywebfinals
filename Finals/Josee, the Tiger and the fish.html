            Equipped with his passion for diving and admiration for marine biology, 
            university student Tsuneo Suzukawa tries his best to juggle several part-time 
            jobs to earn enough money to study abroad. But one night, in a fateful accident, 
            he meets a girl in a wheelchair, driving his current path into a detour.
            The girl, Kumiko who prefers to be called "Josee" initially comes off as rude.
            Tsuneo, however, is then convinced by Josee's grandmother to take on the paid 
            job to be Josee's caretaker. Despite being annoyed with her bossy demeanor, 
            Tsuneo sees the opportunity to save more funds to support his academic dream. 
            Nonetheless, after putting up with Josee's behavior for some time, Tsuneo tries 
            to quit, only to discover Josee's dreams of traversing the outside worldâ€”to 
            experience a life free from her crippling condition.Changing his mind, Tsuneo 
            decides to accompany Josee in exploring the wonders that the world has to offer. 
            Through their time together, the two begin to realize that the traits that bind 
            them may be vital toward fulfilling their respective aspirations.
